# cortex_bioc_rule (Resource)

Manages Behavioral Indicator of Compromise (BIOC) rules in XSIAM. BIOC rules define behavioral patterns that identify potential threats based on sequences of endpoint activities rather than static signatures.

Rules are created in a disabled state by default. MITRE ATT&CK mappings (tactics and techniques) are computed by the system based on the rule definition.

~> **Note:** This resource is only available on XSIAM and requires webapp session authentication (`session_token` or `cortex-login`). Webapp API endpoints are based on XSIAM V3.4 and may differ on other versions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cortex_bioc_rule" "suspicious_powershell" {
  name     = "Suspicious PowerShell Execution"
  severity = "high"
  status   = "ENABLED"
  category = "Execution"
  comment  = "Detects obfuscated PowerShell commands"

  indicator_text = jsonencode({
    type  = "process"
    field = "command_line"
    values = [
      "*-EncodedCommand*",
      "*-enc *",
      "*bypass*-nop*"
    ]
  })
}

resource "cortex_bioc_rule" "lateral_movement" {
  name     = "SMB Lateral Movement"
  severity = "medium"
  category = "Lateral Movement"
  comment  = "Detects potential lateral movement via SMB"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The display name of the BIOC rule.
* `severity` - (Required) The severity level of alerts generated by this rule (e.g., `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`).
* `status` - (Optional) The operational status of the rule. Valid values are `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. Defaults to `DISABLED`.
* `category` - (Optional) The threat category for the rule (e.g., `Execution`, `Lateral Movement`, `Persistence`).
* `comment` - (Optional) A comment or description explaining the rule's purpose.
* `indicator_text` - (Optional) A JSON-encoded object defining the behavioral indicators to match. Specifies the process, file, or network activity patterns that constitute the BIOC.

## Attributes Reference

* `rule_id` - The unique identifier assigned to the BIOC rule by XSIAM.
* `source` - The source of the rule (e.g., `custom` for user-created rules).
* `is_xql` - Whether the rule uses XQL (XSIAM Query Language) syntax.
* `mitre_tactic` - A list of MITRE ATT&CK tactics associated with this rule, computed by the system.
* `mitre_technique` - A list of MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with this rule, computed by the system.

## Import

BIOC rules can be imported using their rule ID:

```shell
terraform import cortex_bioc_rule.suspicious_powershell 12345
```
