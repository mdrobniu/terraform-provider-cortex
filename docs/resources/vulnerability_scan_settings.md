# cortex_vulnerability_scan_settings (Resource)

Manages the singleton vulnerability scan settings configuration in XSIAM. This resource controls the global vulnerability scanning behavior including EULA acceptance, test policies, intrusive scan levels, and target filtering.

This is a singleton resource -- only one `cortex_vulnerability_scan_settings` resource should exist per XSIAM tenant. The EULA must be accepted before vulnerability scanning can be configured.

~> **Note:** This resource is only available on XSIAM and requires webapp session authentication (`session_token` or `cortex-login`). Webapp API endpoints are based on XSIAM V3.4 and may differ on other versions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cortex_vulnerability_scan_settings" "config" {
  eula_accepted            = true
  new_tests_enabled        = true
  pause_testing            = false
  run_tests_on_all_services = false
  intrusive_level          = 2

  target_filter = jsonencode({
    include = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
    exclude = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
  })
}
```

### Minimal Configuration

```terraform
resource "cortex_vulnerability_scan_settings" "config" {
  eula_accepted = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `eula_accepted` - (Required) Whether the End User License Agreement for vulnerability scanning has been accepted. Must be `true` to enable scanning.
* `new_tests_enabled` - (Optional) Whether newly released vulnerability tests are automatically enabled. Defaults to `false`.
* `pause_testing` - (Optional) Whether vulnerability scanning is currently paused. Defaults to `false`.
* `run_tests_on_all_services` - (Optional) Whether to run vulnerability tests against all detected services, not just the primary ones. Defaults to `false`.
* `intrusive_level` - (Optional) The intrusiveness level of vulnerability scans. Valid values are `1` (safe checks only), `2` (moderate -- may cause minor disruption), or `3` (aggressive -- may cause service disruption). Defaults to `1`.
* `target_filter` - (Optional) A JSON-encoded string defining the target filter for vulnerability scans. Specifies which IP ranges or assets to include or exclude from scanning.

## Attributes Reference

All arguments are also exported as attributes.

## Import

The vulnerability scan settings are a singleton and can be imported using the literal string `vulnerability_scan_settings`:

```shell
terraform import cortex_vulnerability_scan_settings.config vulnerability_scan_settings
```
