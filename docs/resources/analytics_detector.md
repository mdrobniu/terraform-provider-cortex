# cortex_analytics_detector (Resource)

Manages analytics detector configurations in XSIAM. Analytics detectors are system-defined machine learning and behavioral analytics rules. Since these detectors are predefined by XSIAM, this resource only allows modifying their `severity` and `status` -- it does not support creating or deleting detectors.

The `global_rule_id` identifies the system-defined detector and is immutable. Most attributes such as `name`, `description`, `original_severity`, and MITRE mappings are read-only and populated from the system definition.

~> **Note:** This resource is only available on XSIAM and requires webapp session authentication (`session_token` or `cortex-login`). Webapp API endpoints are based on XSIAM V3.4 and may differ on other versions.

~> **Important:** This resource manages system-defined detectors. Terraform `create` adopts the existing detector into state, and `destroy` removes it from state without deleting the detector from XSIAM.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cortex_analytics_detector" "brute_force" {
  global_rule_id = "analytics_brute_force_001"
  severity       = "high"
  status         = "ENABLED"
}

resource "cortex_analytics_detector" "impossible_travel" {
  global_rule_id = "analytics_impossible_travel_001"
  severity       = "medium"
  status         = "ENABLED"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `global_rule_id` - (Required, Forces new resource) The unique identifier of the system-defined analytics detector. Changing this value will destroy and recreate the resource (removing old detector from state and adopting the new one).
* `severity` - (Required) The severity level to assign to alerts generated by this detector (e.g., `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`). This overrides the system default severity.
* `status` - (Required) The operational status of the detector. Valid values are `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`.

## Attributes Reference

* `name` - The display name of the analytics detector, as defined by XSIAM.
* `description` - The system-provided description of what this detector identifies.
* `original_severity` - The original default severity as defined by the system, before any user override.
* `source` - The source of the detector (e.g., `XDR Analytics`).
* `mitre_tactic` - A list of MITRE ATT&CK tactics associated with this detector.
* `mitre_technique` - A list of MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with this detector.

## Import

Analytics detectors can be imported using their global rule ID:

```shell
terraform import cortex_analytics_detector.brute_force analytics_brute_force_001
```
